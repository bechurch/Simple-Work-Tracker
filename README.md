# Simple Work Timer
This is a simple timer I wrote to track my time spent on tasks at work and personally. Found it really handy keeping myself on track while working part time remote and thought others might be able to use it.

##Usage
### To Start
Simply naviagte to the repo and type the following (ignore the [] brackets):
* python timer.py [path/to/yourworklog]
### Commands
- start: to start timer
- exit: to exit program
- status: to see how much you have worked relative to your goals
- show: to print current worklog to stdout
- change: to modify the path to your worklog
